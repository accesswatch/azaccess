## Practical best practices for Articulate content
- Captions & transcripts: Always provide accurate captions and a downloadable transcript for audio/video. Use UA captioning workflow and audit captions after auto-generation.
- Keyboard accessibility: Ensure all interactive slides, buttons, and controls are reachable and operable via keyboard (Tab/Enter/Space and visible focus indicators).
- Semantic structure: Use headings, lists, and readable label text rather than purely graphical text. Favor native text blocks over embedded images of text.
- Alt text & descriptions: Provide meaningful alt text for decorative vs. informative images; include long descriptions or transcripts for complex visuals.
- Color & contrast: Verify color contrast for all text and important visuals against WCAG AA ratios (>= 4.5:1 for normal text).
- Avoid inaccessible interactions: If using drag-and-drop or complex custom interactions, provide an alternative interaction or a text-based version.
- Testing: Test published output with common screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation; check exported HTML output on multiple browsers and devices.
- VPATs & conformance notes: Consult Articulate's VPATs for known limitations and vendor-provided workarounds; record any remaining barriers in your course notes.
