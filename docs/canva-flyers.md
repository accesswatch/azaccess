# Canva & Accessible Flyers

This guide helps communications and events teams create accessible flyers and graphics using Canva and similar design tools. It focuses on practical, high-impact steps you can apply immediately and guidance for publishing accessible alternatives.

## Immediate wins (5–15 minutes)

- Use a UA-approved template (keep the Block A logo and color tokens).
- Ensure text is selectable in the source and retain the editable source file (PDF/PNG exports alone are often inaccessible).
- Export an accessible alternative: provide a simple HTML/text version or an accessible PDF alongside the flyer.
- Add a short descriptive summary near the flyer when publishing (for emails, webpages, and event pages).

## Checklist: Before you publish

1. Structure & content
   - Use real text (not flattened images) for all important information.
   - Keep headings and event details in clear reading order (event title, date/time, location, contact, call to action).
2. Contrast & typography
   - Ensure foreground/background contrast meets 4.5:1 for normal text (3:1 for large text).
   - Use generous font sizes (minimum 16px body-equivalent for web; larger for print legibility).
3. Color and visual cues
   - Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning (add icons or text labels).
4. Images and icons
   - Provide alt text for exported images when used on the web or in emails; keep alt concise and meaningful.
5. File export and distribution
   - Export and keep the editable source (Canva project or exported PDF with selectable text).
   - When sharing on webpages or social, include a linked or embedded accessible HTML/text summary.

## Canva-specific tips

- Use Canva templates only as a starting point — verify color tokens and replace low-contrast combinations.
- Avoid placing text over busy background images; use solid overlays with sufficient contrast.
- For multi-column layouts, keep left-to-right reading order and avoid complex wrapping that may be flattened.

## When to provide an alternative

- If the flyer contains essential information presented purely as an image (e.g., stylized poster), publish a text/HTML alternative or accessible PDF with selectable text.

## Publishing patterns and examples

- Email: include the flyer image plus a short text summary and a link to the accessible HTML page or attached accessible PDF.
- Web: embed the flyer image with `alt` and add a short `aria-describedby` reference to a visible summary; also publish a native HTML summary page for event details.
