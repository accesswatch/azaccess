- Use the **built-in styles** in Outlook’s editor; avoid pasting from Word with complex layouts.
- **Add alt text** to images via `Format Picture > Alt Text`.
- **Use high-contrast colors** and keep body text ≥ 12 pt.
- **Include descriptive link text** and underline links.
- **Meeting invites**: Provide agenda, accessibility contact, and meeting link details in the body; enable Teams/Zoom captions beforehand.
- **Run the Accessibility Checker** (`Review > Check Accessibility`) before sending to large audiences.
- **Testing**: Send to yourself and open with keyboard navigation to ensure focus order and reading flow make sense.
