## InDesign
- Build with paragraph/character styles and tag structure (`Window > Articles`) for clean PDF export.
- Use the `Object Export Options` to set alt text for images and mark decorative items.
- Define reading order via Articles panel; export using `Adobe PDF (Interactive)` with “Create Tagged PDF.”

## Acrobat
- Leverage PDF Accessibility Auto-Tag API or Action Wizard for batch tagging, but always spot-check complex layouts.

## Premiere Pro
- Use Speech to Text to generate caption tracks; edit for accuracy before exporting.
- Ensure on-screen graphics have sufficient contrast and are announced in narration.

## Adobe Firefly & Express
- When generating imagery, provide descriptive captions/alt text and verify contrast; avoid stylized text without HTML equivalents when exporting assets.

## Support
- Contact adobe@arizona.edu for training and license assistance.
- Reference Adobe’s Accessibility Conformance Reports for specific apps when working with procurement.
