- Compose in plain-text or simple HTML; avoid copying complex Word layouts.
- Use the **Format > Paragraph styles** menu for headings when sending newsletters via Gmail.
- Provide **alt text** for inserted images (select image > Alt text).
- Ensure **link text is descriptive** and underlined.
- Maintain **high contrast** and avoid conveying information with color only.
- For meeting invites via Google Calendar, include accessibility statement and link to accommodation forms.
- Test with Gmail’s **Screen Reader support** (Settings > Accessibility) if you need to validate reading order.
