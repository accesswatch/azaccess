1. **Recording setup**: Use high-quality microphones and avoid background noise; enable automatic captions during capture.
2. **Edit captions**: After recording, open the Panopto editor, select `Captions`, edit for accuracy, add speaker names, and save.
3. **Add transcripts**: Export caption file for students needing text transcripts; upload to course files.
4. **Slides & materials**: Attach accessible slide decks (tagged PDFs or HTML) alongside the recording.
5. **Player configuration**: Enable downloads only if materials meet accessibility requirements; ensure discussion features have descriptive prompts.
6. **Alternative formats**: Provide audio-only versions with transcripts when video is not essential.
7. **Analytics**: Review Panopto caption usage metrics to prioritize pro captioning where engagement is high.
