1. **Structure with tables carefully**: Use single-column layouts for responsive emails; declare table roles and include `role="presentation"` when tables are purely layout.
2. **Use meaningful subject lines** describing the content or action.
3. **Provide alt text** for images/logos; avoid text-only images for essential information.
4. **Maintain high contrast** for text and buttons; supply bulletproof buttons (live text with background color).
5. **Link clarity**: Underline links and avoid “click here.”
6. **Accessible buttons**: Use `<a>` elements styled as buttons with sufficient padding and `role="button"` if needed; ensure focus states are visible.
7. **Animated GIFs/video**: Offer play buttons linking to captioned content; provide text summary when animation contains vital info.
8. **Testing**: Use Litmus or Email on Acid plus screen reader previews (NVDA + Outlook, VoiceOver + Apple Mail).
