1. **Start with structure**: Apply semantic headings, lists, and table headers in the authoring tool instead of manual styling.
2. **Describe visuals**: Provide alt text for informative graphics; mark decorative images to be skipped by assistive tech.
3. **Mind color & contrast**: Use palettes meeting WCAG ratios and supplement color cues with text or icons.
4. **Link clarity**: Use meaningful link text that explains the destination or action.
5. **Language & reading order**: Set the document language, and for slides or PDFs confirm reading order aligns with visual flow.
6. **Check automatically, review manually**: Run built-in accessibility checkers (Microsoft, Google, Adobe) and conduct a manual skim with a screen reader or read-aloud tool.
7. **Export responsibly**: When converting to PDF or HTML, ensure “Include document structure tags” (or equivalent) is enabled and re-check the final output.
