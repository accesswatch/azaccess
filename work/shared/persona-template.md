1. **Hero block**
   - One-sentence need statement (e.g., “Students need fast, predictable accommodations and accessible course media”).
   - Metric chip (e.g., “Average accommodation processing time: 7 days”).
2. **Top tasks table**
   - Columns: Task, Steps, Primary tools.
3. **Impactful principles & toolset**
   - Present as expandable accordions covering the most critical WCAG 2.2 AA themes for that persona (e.g., focus appearance, dragging movements, target size, alternative text, captions).
   - Reference Accessibility Insights, WebAIM’s WAVE, DubBot, and Microsoft Accessibility Checker as go-to evaluation tools; include links to Deque University/WebAIM resources when relevant.
   - Call out Adobe PDF remediation (tagging, reading order, labels) and alternative text principles where documents/media are produced.
   - Keep the content concise for non-developer personas (students, faculty, staff, etc.) by highlighting 2–3 actionable principles and linking out to deeper resources, while developer personas may include the full checklist.
   - Optionally add a short “Manual review” checklist with 3–5 steps (e.g., keyboard sweep, Accessibility Insights FastPass, WAVE spot-check, DubBot crawl link) so contributors can self-verify before publishing.
4. **Guidance accordions**
   - Each accordion named after a scenario (“Request ASL for events”).
   - Include step-by-step instructions, deadlines, Do/Don’t list, CTAs, and direct links to UA quick references plus external resources.
5. **Tools & contacts**
   - Buttons for portals, forms, phone/email.
6. **Training & community**
   - Workshops, peer groups, on-demand tutorials.
7. **Assistive technologies**
   - Reference `shared/assistive-tech.md` and highlight how this persona’s work must consider JAWS for Windows, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack, Fusion, and ZoomText.
8. **Feedback**
   - Link to barrier report or suggestion form.
9. **Metadata**
   - Footer text with last reviewed date, owner, next review.
