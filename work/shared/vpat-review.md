## Review steps
1. **Check version**: Prefer WCAG 2.1 AA or 2.2 AA templates; note platform versions covered.
2. **Evaluate scoring**:
   - `Supports`: Verify through demonstration/testing.
   - `Partially Supports`: Ensure remarks explain scenarios and planned fixes.
   - `Does Not Support`: Flag as blocker; require remediation or alternatives.
3. **Assess remarks**: Quality remarks describe limitations, workarounds, timelines. Generic statements indicate higher risk.
4. **Cross-reference critical criteria**:
   - 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
   - 1.4.3 Contrast
   - 2.1.1 Keyboard
   - 2.4.3 Focus Order
   - 2.4.7 Focus Visible
   - 3.3.1/3.3.3 Errors
5. **Document risk**: Summarize findings in procurement ticket, assign severity, recommend next steps (pilot, conditions, rejection).

## Questions for vendors
- Provide demo environment for accessibility testing?
- What is your defect escalation process and SLA?
- Can you share roadmap for outstanding accessibility issues?
- Do you have third-party audits or certifications?
