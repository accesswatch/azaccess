- [ ] Share syllabus statements detailing accommodations process and response timelines.
- [ ] Provide multiple means of engagement (captions, transcripts, readable slides, tactile/visual aids).
- [ ] Post materials in Brightspace at least 48 hours before class when possible.
- [ ] Offer alternative ways to participate (chat, discussion boards, polling) to accommodate different communication preferences.
- [ ] Structure assessments so extended time/flexible formats can be delivered without last-minute changes.
- [ ] Check third-party tools (polling, homework platforms) for accessibility and document approved alternatives.
- [ ] Solicit anonymous feedback mid-term on accessibility experience and adjust accordingly.
