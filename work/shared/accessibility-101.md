## What we mean by accessibility
- Accessibility ensures everyone—including people using assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, captions, or alternative input devices—can perceive, understand, and interact with UA experiences.
- At Arizona, accessibility covers websites, documents, media, apps, classroom technologies, events, and in-person services.

## Why it matters at UA
- Federal requirements: Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504/508 require public universities to provide equal access to digital and physical services.
- Campus values: Inclusive design supports student success, research, recruitment, and community partnerships.
- Risk reduction: Accessible experiences lower legal exposure, remediation cost, and support demands.

## Standards we follow
- **WCAG 2.2 AA** — industry benchmark for web, apps, and many documents.
- **UA policies & Title II roadmap** — define roles, timelines, and escalation paths for all colleges and units.
- **Assistive Technology coverage** — outlines required testing combinations (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack, Fusion, ZoomText) so releases reflect real user setups.

## How UA teams can get help
1. **Pick your persona guide** for tailored checklists, tools, and training.
2. **Request support** for reviews, captioning, procurement, accommodations, or event planning.
3. **Report barriers** via the DRC Access Report so we can respond within two business days.
4. **Join trainings & office hours** to build skills and meet others doing similar work.
