## Why Accessible Procurement Matters

The best time to ensure accessibility is **before you buy**. Once a contract is signed, you have limited leverage to request accessibility improvements.

### The Cost of Inaccessible Purchases
- **Legal risk:** Using inaccessible technology can result in complaints and lawsuits
- **Remediation costs:** After-purchase fixes are expensive and often impossible
- **Accommodation burden:** Individual workarounds for every user with disabilities
- **Exclusion:** Students, faculty, and staff unable to use required tools

### Applies To

Accessibility review is required for:
- Software applications and SaaS platforms
- Learning management system (LMS) integrations
- Website platforms and content management systems
- Mobile applications
- Hardware with software interfaces
- Electronic documents and digital content
- Multimedia and streaming services

## The Procurement Process

### Step 1: Identify Accessibility Requirements
At the start of your procurement:
- Confirm the purchase involves technology used by people
- Determine who will use the product (students, employees, public)
- Note any specific accessibility needs you're aware of
- Contact the Digital Accessibility team for guidance if needed

### Step 2: Include Accessibility in RFP/RFQ
Your request for proposals should include:
- Statement that accessibility is a requirement
- Request for VPAT/ACR (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)
- Reference to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard
- Questions about accessibility roadmap
- Evaluation criteria that includes accessibility

### Step 3: Request VPAT from Vendor
Ask vendors to provide:
- **VPAT/ACR:** Based on current version (VPAT 2.4 or later preferred)
- **Reporting standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- **Date:** VPAT should be less than 2 years old
- **Version:** VPAT should match the product version being purchased

> **Red flags:** Vendors who don't have a VPAT, provide outdated VPATs, or claim "full compliance" without documentation.

### Step 4: Submit for Accessibility Review
1. Submit the VPAT/ACR to the Digital Accessibility team via the **ServiceNow Accessibility Review Request form**
2. Include product name, version, and intended use (e.g., student-facing, faculty-only, or public)
3. Provide vendor contact information for follow-up technical questions
4. Allow 5–7 business days for an initial risk assessment report

### Step 5: Review Results and Decide
After review, you'll receive:
- **Accessibility score:** Overall assessment of product accessibility
- **Risk level:** Low, Medium, or High
- **Key issues:** Critical accessibility gaps identified
- **Recommendation:** Proceed, proceed with conditions, or seek alternatives

### Step 6: Include Accessibility in Contract
For approved purchases, contracts should include:
- Accessibility requirements and standards
- Vendor commitment to remediate issues
- Timeline for accessibility improvements
- Right to audit or request updated VPATs
- Consequences for non-compliance

### Process Flowchart
1. **Need identified** — Involves technology?
2. Yes → **Request VPAT** from vendor
3. **Submit VPAT** to Digital Accessibility team
4. **Review completed** — Risk assessment
5. Low risk → **Proceed** with standard terms
6. Medium risk → **Proceed with conditions** (remediation plan)
7. High risk → **Seek alternatives** or document exception
8. **Contract executed** with accessibility terms

## Vendor Accessibility Evaluation Questions

Use these questions during the RFP/RFQ process to evaluate a vendor's commitment to accessibility. They align with [DOJ Title II web accessibility requirements](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/) and the April 2026 compliance deadline.

> **How to use:** Include relevant questions in your RFP/RFQ. Use the "What to look for" guidance to score vendor responses.

### 1. Accessibility in the Development Lifecycle

**Ask the vendor:**
- How do you embed accessibility throughout your development lifecycle — from requirements and design through development, testing, and release?
- What methodologies and tools do you use to ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., automated testing, manual audits, usability testing with people who use assistive technology)?

**What to look for:**
- A named technical standard (WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 Level AA)
- Specific testing tools and methods — not just "we test for accessibility"
- Evidence of both automated and manual testing
- Use of recognized methodologies (e.g., Trusted Tester)
- Dedicated accessibility staff or roles
- Designer, developer, and QA training programs

### 2. Alignment with DOJ Guidelines

**Ask the vendor:**
- How will you ensure your product meets the DOJ web accessibility requirements for state and educational institutions by the April 2026 deadline?
- Can you share a roadmap or timeline for achieving compliance, including milestones, checkpoints, or external audits?

**What to look for:**
- Explicit awareness of the DOJ rule and the April 2026 deadline
- A concrete plan — not just "we're working on it"
- Willingness to share VPAT reports and progress updates
- If no dedicated accessibility roadmap exists, ask how accessibility is prioritized within the overall product roadmap

### 3. Ongoing Accessibility Maintenance

**Ask the vendor:**
- What measures are in place to maintain compliance as standards and guidelines evolve?
- How do you prioritize accessibility when planning product updates, patches, or new feature releases?

**What to look for:**
- Ongoing training programs (not one-time)
- Accessibility as a requirement in acceptance criteria for new features
- Process for monitoring standards updates (WCAG, DOJ guidelines)
- Dedicated accessibility personnel or team

### 4. Response to Accessibility Issues

**Ask the vendor:**
- What Service Level Agreements (SLAs) do you have for addressing accessibility bugs?
- How do you ensure critical accessibility issues are resolved in a timely and transparent manner?
- What escalation paths exist for unresolved or high-impact accessibility issues?

**What to look for:**
- A defined severity classification for accessibility issues (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Documented response timelines for each severity level
- Clear escalation procedures
- Willingness to share the SLA in writing

### 5. Partnership and Collaboration

**Ask the vendor:**
- Are you open to a collaborative partnership with our accessibility and technical teams to address ongoing compliance challenges?
- What communication channels will you establish (e.g., regular check-ins, joint working groups, shared issue trackers)?

**What to look for:**
- Willingness to receive and act on accessibility feedback
- A defined process for reporting and tracking accessibility issues
- Openness to regular accessibility-focused meetings
- Commitment to preventing issues, not just fixing reported ones

### 6. Transparency and Reporting

**Ask the vendor:**
- How will you provide transparency into your accessibility processes, progress, and status?
- Are you willing to share regular reports on accessibility compliance, including open issues and resolutions?
- Do you support external or third-party accessibility audits?

**What to look for:**
- Willingness to share VPAT reports on a regular cadence
- Openness to scheduled progress calls
- Third-party testing (not solely self-reported)
- A "no" to any of these is a significant concern

### 7. Training and Certifications

**Ask the vendor:**
- What accessibility training or certifications do your development and QA teams hold (e.g., IAAP CPACC, WAS)?
- How do you ensure all relevant team members are continuously educated about accessibility?
- Would you co-host accessibility workshops or training sessions with our institution?

**What to look for:**
- Named certifications (CPACC, WAS, or equivalent)
- Ongoing training — not just onboarding
- Willingness to collaborate on knowledge sharing
- A dedicated accessibility specialist or team

### 8. User-Centric Testing

**Ask the vendor:**
- Do you test your product with users of assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, voice recognition, switch access)?
- Can you share examples of how user feedback has influenced accessibility improvements?
- Are you open to partnering with us to conduct user testing with people with disabilities?

**What to look for:**
- Direct testing with assistive technology users (strongest signal)
- If no direct user testing, a process for accepting and acting on user-reported issues
- Specific examples of feedback-driven improvements
- Openness to institution-led testing

### 9. Accountability and Continuous Improvement

**Ask the vendor:**
- How do you measure the success of your accessibility initiatives?
- Can you describe a recent accessibility issue that was identified and resolved? What lessons were learned?
- What mechanisms ensure continuous improvement after initial compliance?

**What to look for:**
- Measurable goals tied to WCAG conformance
- Willingness to share real examples (not just promises)
- Evidence that lessons learned feed back into process improvements
- Accessibility integrated into product acceptance criteria

### 10. Contingency Plans and Risk Management

**Ask the vendor:**
- If unforeseen challenges arise in meeting accessibility compliance by April 2026, what contingency plans do you have?
- How will you address critical gaps identified late in the compliance process?

**What to look for:**
- Leadership commitment to prioritizing accessibility
- Ability to reprioritize product roadmap for accessibility issues
- Cross-functional support (not just engineering)
- A realistic assessment of risks — not blanket assurances

## Understanding VPATs

The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is the standard format for vendors to report product accessibility.

### What's in a VPAT
- **Product information:** Name, version, date
- **Evaluation methods:** How accessibility was tested
- **WCAG criteria:** Row-by-row assessment of success criteria
- **Conformance levels:** Supports, Partially Supports, Does Not Support, Not Applicable
- **Remarks:** Explanations and details

### Conformance Level Meanings

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Supports | Functionality meets the criterion without known defects |
| Partially Supports | Some functionality meets the criterion; some gaps exist |
| Does Not Support | Majority of functionality does not meet the criterion |
| Not Applicable | Criterion does not apply to the product |
| Not Evaluated | Not tested (concerning if used frequently) |

### Red Flags in VPATs
- "Supports" for every criterion (unrealistic)
- Many "Not Applicable" without good reason
- Vague or missing remarks
- Old date or outdated WCAG version (pre-2.1)
- Version mismatch with product being purchased
- No testing methodology described

See [Detailed VPAT Review Guide](vpat-review.html) for more.

## Accessibility Contract Language

Standard accessibility language for technology contracts:

### Requirements Clause
> "Vendor agrees that the Product shall conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA success criteria, as published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Vendor shall provide an updated Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) upon request, and at minimum with each major product release."

### Remediation Clause
> "If accessibility defects are identified, Vendor shall develop a remediation plan within 30 days and complete remediation within a mutually agreed timeline. Critical accessibility barriers that prevent users with disabilities from accessing core functionality shall be remediated within 90 days or an interim accommodation shall be provided."

### Audit Rights Clause
> "University reserves the right to conduct or commission accessibility testing of the Product at any time. Vendor shall cooperate with such testing and provide access to test environments as reasonably requested."

### Termination Clause
> "Material failure to meet accessibility requirements that renders the Product unusable for users with disabilities, if not remediated within 90 days of written notice, shall constitute grounds for termination without penalty."

## Handling Exceptions

Sometimes a product with accessibility gaps may still be needed. The exception process ensures informed decisions.

### When Exceptions May Apply
- No accessible alternative exists in the market
- Product serves a critical function with limited users
- Vendor has committed roadmap for accessibility improvements
- Effective workarounds or accommodations are available

### Exception Requirements
To approve an exception, document:
1. **Business justification:** Why this product is necessary
2. **Alternatives considered:** What other products were evaluated
3. **Risk assessment:** Who is affected and how
4. **Mitigation plan:** How users with disabilities will be accommodated
5. **Remediation timeline:** Vendor's plan to improve accessibility
6. **Review date:** When the exception will be reconsidered

### Exception Approval
- **Low risk exceptions:** Digital Accessibility Director
- **Medium risk exceptions:** Unit leadership + Digital Accessibility Director
- **High risk exceptions:** Steering Committee approval required

## The Three-Step Framework

Accessibility should be considered at each step of the procurement process. This framework, adapted from the [University of Washington's Accessible Technology procurement model](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/procurement/), provides a structured approach.

> **Key Principle:** Those responsible for making decisions about which products to procure must consider accessibility as one of the criteria for acquisition. This is especially critical for enterprise-level systems and other technologies that affect a large number of students, faculty, and/or staff.
> — Adapted from University of Washington Accessible Technology

### Step 1: Solicit Accessibility Information

Suppliers are expected to have available an **Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)** for each of their products and services, documenting their current state of accessibility as measured by WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA.

- Completing an ACR is a standard business practice that all technology vendors are expected to be familiar with
- ACRs are typically created from a [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat)
- **Third-party evaluations are encouraged**, especially for suppliers who have insufficient expertise in-house to accurately audit their own product

### Step 2: Validate Accessibility Information Received

When suppliers provide accessibility documentation, these materials must be reviewed and verified. When reviewing a supplier's ACR, consider:

1. **Does the ACR include all required information?** At a minimum: product name and version, report date, contact information for follow-up questions, and description of evaluation methods.
2. **Is the ACR reasonably current?** If the report date is more than a few months old, the information may be outdated unless the product hasn't been updated during that time.
3. **Who completed the report?** A report prepared by an independent third-party accessibility consultant is more credible than a self-report.
4. **How accessible is the product?** An ACR that declares 100% accessibility (i.e., "Supports" on every criterion) is suspicious—perfectly accessible products are extremely rare. A transparent ACR that accurately acknowledges accessibility problems is preferred.
5. **Do you understand how people with disabilities will use the product?** The Remarks/Explanations column should provide sufficient detail to answer "Yes" to this question.
6. **When can you expect the supplier to fix identified problems?** Request an accessibility roadmap indicating their plan for resolving issues.

> **Quick Keyboard Test:** One easy test that anyone can perform without specialized tools: **Test the product with a keyboard**. Anything accessible with a mouse should also be accessible with keyboard alone. If a product fails the keyboard test, this is a strong indicator of other accessibility problems.
> — University of Washington Accessible Technology

### Step 3: Include Accessibility Assurances in Contracts

All technology suppliers are expected to provide assurances that their product is either compliant with accessibility standards, or is working toward compliance within a reasonable timeline.

- Attach a **Digital Accessibility Rider** to all contracts for applicable goods and services
- Include specific procedures for addressing accessibility within the procurement process
- Specify consequences for non-compliance and right to audit

## The Keyboard Accessibility Test

Before finalizing any technology purchase, conduct this simple but revealing test. Based on the [UW Accessible Technology keyboard checklist](https://www.washington.edu/accesstech/checklist/keyboard/).

### How to Test
1. Set aside your mouse and use only your keyboard
2. Press `Tab` to move forward through interactive elements
3. Press `Shift`+`Tab` to move backward
4. Press `Enter` or `Space` to activate buttons and links
5. Use arrow keys to navigate within menus, tabs, and other widgets
6. Press `Escape` to close dialogs and menus

### What to Check
- [ ] Can you reach every interactive element (links, buttons, form fields, menus)?
- [ ] Is focus always visible — do you know where you are on the page?
- [ ] Does focus move in a logical order (generally left to right, top to bottom)?
- [ ] Can you operate all menus, dropdowns, and dialogs?
- [ ] Can you escape from any component (no keyboard traps)?
- [ ] Can you complete the primary workflow entirely by keyboard?

> **Failure Indicator:** If the product fails the keyboard test — if you cannot accomplish tasks without a mouse — this is a **strong indicator of deeper accessibility problems**. Request demonstration of keyboard support from the vendor before proceeding.

## Digital Accessibility Checklist Framework

This checklist framework is adapted from the [University of Washington's Digital Accessibility Checklist](https://www.washington.edu/accesstech/checklist/), which organizes checkpoints by technology type and impact.
