<h3>UA Brand + Accessibility</h3>
<p>Accessible branding isn't a separate effort — it's how we apply the <a href="https://brand.arizona.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UA brand</a> correctly. Every color pairing, font choice, and template in this guide aligns with both UA Brand Guidelines and WCAG 2.2 Level AA. Questions?

## UA Branding and Accessibility {#overview}

Accessible branding isn't a limitation — it's a strategic advantage. Designs that meet accessibility standards reach more people, perform better on all devices, work in all environments (sunlight, dark rooms, low-bandwidth), and demonstrate UA's commitment to inclusive excellence.

### Why It Matters at UA

- **Inclusive Excellence:** Our brand should reflect our commitment to all members of the Wildcat family — including the 26% of adults with disabilities
- **Legal Compliance:** ADA Title II requires all UA digital communications to meet WCAG 2.1 AA by April 2026. Brand materials are included.
- **Better Design:** Accessible design constraints often produce cleaner, more effective communications. High contrast = more readable. Clear fonts = more professional. Logical structure = easier to scan.
- **Broader Reach:** Accessible communications work better for everyone — mobile users, people in bright sunlight, people reading quickly, ESL readers, and people using assistive technology

### Plan Accessibility Early

Retrofitting accessibility into existing brand materials is expensive and time-consuming. Build it in from the start:

- **Color palette documentation** → Include contrast ratios and approved pairings
- **Typography standards** → Specify accessible font families, minimum sizes, and spacing
- **Logo usage guidelines** → Include alt text recommendations and minimum sizes
- **Template libraries** → Build accessibility into every template, not as an add-on
- **Photography/imagery guidelines** → Include alt text style guide and inclusive representation standards

### WCAG Criteria for Brand Materials

| Criterion | Requirement | Brand Application |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1.1 Non-text Content (A) | Text alternatives for images | Alt text for logos, icons, brand photography |
| 1.4.1 Use of Color (A) | Don't use color as the only indicator | Error states, status indicators, categories |
| 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum (AA) | 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text | All text/background color pairings |
| 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA) | Text resizable to 200% | Font sizes and layout flexibility |
| 1.4.5 Images of Text (AA) | Use real text, not images of text | Branded headers, banners, social graphics |
| 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA) | 3:1 for UI components | Icons, buttons, borders, focus indicators |
| 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA) | Content adapts to user spacing preferences | Line height, letter spacing, word spacing |

## Getting Started: 5-Minute Brand Check {#getting-started}

Before diving into the details, run this quick check on any brand material you're creating:

### The 5-Question Brand Accessibility Check

1. **Can you read every word?** Check that all text has sufficient contrast against its background — test with the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
2. **Can you read it on a phone?** Text should be large enough to read without zooming. Body text: 16px minimum for web.
3. **Does it work in grayscale?** If you remove all color, can you still understand the content? Color must not be the only way information is conveyed.
4. **Is the text real text?** Text that's part of an image can't be resized, searched, translated, or read by screen readers. Use real text whenever possible.
5. **Does every image have alt text guidance?** When the brand material includes images, document what the alt text should be.

> **If all five answers are "yes"**, your brand material is in good shape. Read on for the detailed guidance.

## Accessible Color Palettes {#colors}

### Contrast Requirements (WCAG 1.4.3, 1.4.11)

WCAG defines minimum contrast ratios between text/graphics and their backgrounds:

| Use Case | Minimum Ratio (AA) | Enhanced (AAA) | How to Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body text (under 18pt / 14pt bold) | **4.5:1** | 7:1 | [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} |
| Large text (18pt+ / 14pt+ bold) | **3:1** | 4.5:1 | [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} |
| UI components (buttons, icons, borders) | **3:1** | — | [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} |
| Focus indicators | **3:1** | — | [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} |

> **What counts as "large text"?** 18pt (24px) regular weight, or 14pt (18.5px) bold. Anything smaller must meet the stricter 4.5:1 ratio.

### Building an Accessible Palette

1. **Start with brand primaries:** Test your main colors against white and black backgrounds
2. **Create approved pairings:** Document every text/background combination and its contrast ratio
3. **Add utility colors:** Define colors specifically for text, backgrounds, borders, links, and states
4. **Test in context:** Check contrast in actual use — buttons, links, form fields, headings, body text
5. **Test for color blindness:** Run your palette through [Who Can Use](https://www.whocanuse.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Coblis Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

### UArizona Brand Colors — Contrast Reference

| Color | Name | Hex | On White (#FFF) | On Black (#000) | Use For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span style="color:#AB0520">■</span> | Arizona Red | #AB0520 | **7.3:1** ✅ All text | 2.9:1 ❌ | Headings, emphasis, buttons on white/light |
| <span style="color:#0C234B">■</span> | UA Navy | #0C234B | **14.2:1** ✅ All text | 1.5:1 ❌ | Body text, headings on white/light |
| <span style="color:#378DBD">■</span> | Oasis Blue | #378DBD | **3.2:1** ⚠️ Large only | 6.6:1 ✅ All text | Large text/icons on white; any text on dark |
| <span style="color:#1E5288">■</span> | Azurite | #1E5288 | **7.8:1** ✅ All text | 2.7:1 ❌ | Alternative to Navy; safe for all text on white |
| <span style="color:#70B865">■</span> | Prickly Pear | #70B865 | **2.6:1** ❌ | 7.7:1 ✅ All text | Icons/accents on light; text on dark |
| <span style="color:#E2E9EB">■</span> | Cool Gray | #E2E9EB | 1.3:1 ❌ | **16.0:1** ✅ All text | Background only (never for text) |

### Approved Text/Background Pairings

**Safe to use everywhere (body and heading text):**

| Text Color | Background | Ratio | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| UA Navy (#0C234B) | White (#FFFFFF) | 14.2:1 | Best combination for readability |
| UA Navy (#0C234B) | Cool Gray (#E2E9EB) | 11.3:1 | Excellent for alternating sections |
| Arizona Red (#AB0520) | White (#FFFFFF) | 7.3:1 | Strong for headings and emphasis |
| White (#FFFFFF) | UA Navy (#0C234B) | 14.2:1 | Excellent for dark sections/headers |
| White (#FFFFFF) | Arizona Red (#AB0520) | 7.3:1 | Bold — use for CTAs and alerts |
| White (#FFFFFF) | Azurite (#1E5288) | 7.8:1 | Professional dark sections |

**Use with caution (large text and icons only):**

| Text Color | Background | Ratio | Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Oasis Blue (#378DBD) | White (#FFFFFF) | 3.2:1 | Large text (18pt+) and icons only |
| Oasis Blue (#378DBD) | Cool Gray (#E2E9EB) | 2.6:1 | ❌ Fails — do not use |

**Never use:**

- Light gray text on white or light backgrounds
- Oasis Blue for body text on light backgrounds
- Any color-only state indication without a text/icon companion
- Red and green as the only differentiators (color blindness)

### Tools for Checking Contrast

| Tool | Type | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} | Web | Quick hex-value checks |
| [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} | Desktop app | Eyedropper tool for any on-screen element |

## Typography {#typography}

### Choosing Accessible Fonts

Not all fonts are equally readable. The characteristics that matter most:

- **Clear letterforms:** Can you distinguish between I (capital i), l (lowercase L), and 1 (the number)? Between O (letter) and 0 (zero)?
- **Consistent spacing:** Even letter and word spacing without cramped or variable widths
- **Open counters:** The interior spaces in letters like "a", "e", "g", "o" should be generous
- **Good x-height:** Taller lowercase letters relative to capitals improves readability
- **Multiple weights:** Regular, medium, bold, and semibold available for hierarchy without relying on size alone

### Recommended Font Types

| Type | Good For | Recommended Options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sans-serif | Screens, body text, UI | Open Sans, Source Sans Pro, Inter, Lato, Roboto | Default choice for web and digital |
| Serif | Print, headings, academic | Georgia, Merriweather, Source Serif Pro | Good for print materials and formal documents |
| Monospace | Code, tabular data | Source Code Pro, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code | Use in technical documentation and data |
| Accessibility-designed | Any use | [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Lexie Readable | Designed specifically for low vision readers |

> **Recommendation:** [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a free font designed by the Braille Institute specifically for low-vision readers. It maximizes character distinction — every letter is as different as possible from every other letter. Consider it for any audience that includes people with low vision.

### Fonts to Avoid

- **Decorative or script fonts** for body text (Papyrus, Comic Sans, Brush Script)
- **All-caps text** for more than a few words (harder to read, screen readers may spell out)
- **Ultra-light weights** (100–200) for body text (disappear on lower-quality displays)
- **Condensed fonts** for extended reading (reduced letter spacing strains eyes)
- **Fonts without multiple weights** (can't create hierarchy without changing size)
- **Custom icon fonts** without text alternatives (use SVG icons instead)

### Sizing Guidelines

| Element | Web Minimum | Web Recommended | Print Minimum | Print Recommended |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Body text | 16px (1rem) | 16–18px | 10pt | 11–12pt |
| Small text (captions, footnotes) | 14px | 14–16px | 8pt | 9–10pt |
| Headings (H1) | 24px | 28–36px | 18pt | 20–24pt |
| Line height | 1.4 | 1.5–1.6 | 1.3 | 1.4–1.5 |
| Paragraph spacing | — | 1.5× line height | — | 6–12pt after |
| Line length | — | 50–75 characters | — | 45–75 characters |

### Text Spacing (WCAG 1.4.12)

Users with dyslexia and low vision may override your text spacing settings. Your design must not break when these overrides are applied:

| Property | Minimum Override to Support |
|---|---|
| Line height | 1.5× the font size |
| Letter spacing | 0.12× the font size |
| Word spacing | 0.16× the font size |
| Paragraph spacing | 2× the font size |

**How to support this:** Use relative units (em, rem, %) instead of fixed pixels for spacing. Don't clip overflow on text containers. Test by applying the above overrides in your browser's dev tools.

## Logos and Icons {#logos}

### Logo Accessibility Requirements

- **Provide multiple versions:** Full color, single color (for dark backgrounds), and reversed (white on dark)
- **Don't rely on color:** Logo should be recognizable in grayscale — test by desaturating
- **Minimum size:** Document the smallest size where the logo remains legible (typically 30–40px height for web)
- **Clear space:** Define minimum padding around the logo so it doesn't blend with surrounding content
- **Alt text guidance:** Document the standard alt text for each use case

### Logo Alt Text Patterns

| Usage | HTML | Alt Text |
|---|---|---|
| Logo links to homepage | `<a href="/"><img src="logo.svg" alt="University of Arizona — Home"></a>` | Destination + organization name |
| Logo next to visible name | `<img src="logo.svg" alt="">` + `<span>University of Arizona</span>` | Empty alt (text provides the name) |
| Logo in page header (no link) | `<img src="logo.svg" alt="University of Arizona">` | Organization name |
| College/unit sub-brand | `<img src="cos-logo.svg" alt="College of Science">` | Specific unit name |

```html
<!-- Logo linking to homepage — accessible pattern -->
<a href="/">
  <img src="ua-logo.svg" alt="University of Arizona — Home">
</a>

<!-- Logo with adjacent text name — decorative -->
<div class="brand">
  <img src="ua-logo.svg" alt="">
  <span>University of Arizona</span>
</div>
```

### Icon Guidelines

- **Size:** Minimum 24×24px visual size; minimum 44×44px touch/click target
- **Contrast:** 3:1 against adjacent background (WCAG 1.4.11)
- **Labels:** Always provide text labels alongside icons — icon-only buttons need `aria-label`
- **Consistency:** Same icon = same action across all brand materials
- **Format:** Use SVG for web icons (scalable, styleable, accessible)

### Accessible Icon Implementation

```html
<!-- Preferred: Icon with visible text label -->
<button>
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
    <use href="#icon-download"></use>
  </svg>
  Download Report
</button>

<!-- When icon-only is necessary: provide aria-label -->
<button aria-label="Search">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
    <use href="#icon-search"></use>
  </svg>
</button>

<!-- Never: icon without any accessible name -->
<!-- ❌ <button><svg>...</svg></button> -->
```

## Imagery and Photography {#imagery}

### Inclusive Representation

Brand photography should authentically represent the full diversity of the Wildcat community:

- **Disability representation:** Include people with visible and non-visible disabilities in natural settings — studying, socializing, working, and leading
- **Assistive technology:** Show assistive technology (wheelchairs, screen readers, hearing aids, service animals) in everyday, organic use — not as the focal point of the image
- **Diversity beyond disability:** Represent diverse ages, ethnicities, body types, gender expressions, and cultural backgrounds
- **Avoid "inspiration porn":** Don't frame people with disabilities as heroic for doing ordinary activities. People studying, working, and living are just people.
- **Context matters:** People with disabilities should appear in all types of content, not only in disability-related materials

### Alt Text Style Guide

Include these guidelines in your brand standards documentation:

**Photography alt text should:**

- Describe the **content and context**, not the visual style ("Student presenting research at poster session" not "Photo of students")
- Include **relevant details** about people, actions, settings, and objects
- Be **concise** — 125 characters or less when possible; longer for complex images with essential detail
- **Not mention disability** unless it's directly relevant to the message
- Use **neutral, respectful language** when disability is relevant ("student using a wheelchair" not "wheelchair-bound student")

**Alt text examples:**

| Image | Good Alt Text | Poor Alt Text |
|---|---|---|
| Student in wheelchair at graduation | "Graduate celebrates at UA commencement ceremony" | "Handicapped person at graduation" |
| Research lab photo | "Students analyze samples in the biochemistry research lab" | "Photo of people in lab" |
| Campus landmark | "Old Main building framed by palm trees at sunset" | "University building" |
| Group study session | "Study group reviews notes in the Student Union Memorial Center" | "Students" |
| Decorative campus scenery | `alt=""` (empty — decorative) | "Beautiful photo of campus" |

### Text Over Images

When placing text over photographs or illustrations:

1. **Add a solid or semi-transparent overlay:** Use UA Navy or white at 80–90% opacity behind text
2. **Test worst-case contrast:** Check the text against both the lightest and darkest areas visible through the overlay
3. **Better alternative:** Use a solid color block for the text area; place the photo adjacent to or above the text
4. **Avoid:** Transparent text overlays, text over busy image areas, gradient overlays that create inconsistent contrast
5. **Test at multiple sizes:** Contrast that works on desktop may fail on mobile where the image and text are smaller

## Accessible Templates {#templates}

### Why Templates Matter

Templates with accessibility built in are the highest-leverage investment you can make. A single accessible template can prevent thousands of inaccessible documents.

### Document Templates (Word, Google Docs)

Build these features into every document template:

- **Pre-configured heading styles** (Heading 1, 2, 3) with UA fonts and colors
- **Accessible color palettes** — only approved color pairings in the theme
- **Table styles** with header row formatting and clear borders
- **Alt text placeholder** — include a text box near images that says "⚠️ Add alt text to this image"
- **Metadata fields** — document title, author, language pre-filled
- **Instructions** — a "How to use this template accessibly" section on the last page (delete before sharing)

**Template distribution:** Store templates in a central SharePoint location or shared drive. Include a README with accessibility instructions.

### Presentation Templates (PowerPoint, Google Slides)

- **Slide layouts** with content placeholders in proper reading order (Title → Content → Notes)
- **Unique slide title placeholders** — every slide must have a unique title (even if visually hidden)
- **High-contrast text styles** — UA Navy on white or white on UA Navy
- **Alt text guidance** — instruction text in notes section: "Add alt text to all images on this slide"
- **Speaker notes section** — encourage presenters to write detailed notes (they serve as a text alternative)
- **Slide master fonts** — set to accessible system fonts, minimum 24pt for body, 36pt+ for titles

> **Testing your template:** Create 3–4 sample slides with different content types (text, images, charts, tables). Run the PowerPoint Accessibility Checker. Navigate with Tab to verify reading order. Present with a screen reader to test the full experience.

### Social Media Templates (Canva, Photoshop)

- **Text-safe zones** marked clearly — ensure text always has a high-contrast background
- **Minimum font sizes** enforced — 24pt+ for standard social image sizes
- **Color-checked palettes** — only approved brand color combinations loaded
- **Alt text guide** — include a companion document with alt text writing instructions
- **CamelCase hashtag guide** — #BearDown not #beardown, #WildcatWednesday not #wildcatwednesday

See the [Canva & Accessible Flyers guide](canva-flyers.html) for detailed social media publishing patterns.

### Email Templates (HTML, Mailchimp, Emma)

- **Semantic HTML structure** — proper `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>` tags (not `<div>` with inline styles for everything)
- **Alt text on all images** — including the header banner, logo, and decorative elements
- **Accessible button styles** — real `<a>` links styled as buttons with sufficient contrast and padding
- **Plain text version** — always provide a plain text alternative for every HTML email
- **Preview text** — write meaningful preview text (the first ~90 characters visible in inbox)
- **Table-based layout (for email)** — use `role="presentation"` on layout tables so screen readers skip the table structure

```html
<!-- Accessible email button -->
<a href="https://example.arizona.edu/register" 
   style="background-color:#AB0520; color:#ffffff; 
          padding:12px 24px; text-decoration:none; 
          border-radius:4px; font-size:16px; 
          display:inline-block;">
  Register for the Workshop
</a>
```

### Template Maintenance

- **Review quarterly:** Check that templates still meet current brand guidelines and accessibility standards
- **Version control:** Date-stamp templates and retire old versions
- **Feedback loop:** Include a "Report an accessibility issue" contact in template documentation
- **Testing:** Run the accessibility checker on template samples annually

## Dark Mode & High Contrast {#dark-mode}

### Supporting Display Preferences

Modern operating systems let users choose display modes. Your brand colors need to work in all of them:

- **Light mode:** Standard — light backgrounds, dark text (your default palette)
- **Dark mode:** Inverted — dark backgrounds, light text (increasingly popular)
- **High contrast:** Enhanced contrast for users with low vision
- **Inverted colors:** Full color inversion at the OS level

### Dark Mode Color Considerations

| Light Mode | Dark Mode Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UA Navy text on white | White text on UA Navy | Direct reversal works well |
| Arizona Red on white | Arizona Red on dark gray (#1a1a1a) → 5.8:1 | Test contrast — may need lighter variant |
| Cool Gray background | Dark gray (#1a1a1a or #121212) background | Don't use pure black (#000) — too harsh |
| Oasis Blue accent | Lighter Oasis Blue variant for dark backgrounds | Original Oasis passes on dark (6.6:1) |

### CSS Implementation

```css
/* Define brand colors as CSS custom properties */
:root {
  --ua-navy: #0C234B;
  --ua-red: #AB0520;
  --ua-oasis: #378DBD;
  --ua-bg: #FFFFFF;
  --ua-text: #0C234B;
  --ua-text-muted: #4A4A4A;
}

/* Dark mode overrides */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --ua-bg: #1a1a1a;
    --ua-text: #EBEBEB;
    --ua-text-muted: #B0B0B0;
    /* Verify all contrast ratios in dark mode */
  }
}

/* High contrast mode */
@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
  :root {
    --ua-text: #000000;
    --ua-bg: #FFFFFF;
    /* Maximum contrast */
  }
}
```

> **Testing dark mode:** Enable dark mode on your OS, then view your site/document. Does every text element remain readable? Are interactive elements still distinguishable? Do images with transparent backgrounds look wrong?
