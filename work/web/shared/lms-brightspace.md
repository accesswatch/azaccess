1. **Content modules**: Use HTML templates with semantic headings; avoid pasting from Word without cleaning formatting.
2. **Images & multimedia**: Add alt text, provide transcripts/captions, and ensure embedded players are keyboard accessible.
3. **Quizzes**: Set special access for extended time, allow file uploads or alternative question types when needed.
4. **Discussions**: Encourage descriptive subjects; remind students to caption or describe media they post.
5. **Tables**: Use simple structures; designate header rows/columns via HTML Editor.
6. **Links & buttons**: Make link text descriptive; verify that LTI tools meet accessibility requirements or provide alternatives.
7. **Course check**: Run Brightspace’s Accessibility Checker on each page and fix flagged issues before publishing.
8. **Announcements**: Include text alternatives for banner images, avoid flashing/gifs.
