## Key points
- Public entities must conform public-facing web content and mobile apps to **WCAG 2.1 AA** (DOJ encourages 2.2 alignment).
- Compliance deadline: **April 24, 2026** for large entities (UA), **April 26, 2027** for smaller entities.
- Applies to content created or updated on/after the deadline; limited exceptions exist for archived content, preexisting conventional electronic documents, individualized secure documents, and some third-party content. Exceptions still require alternative access when requested.
- Mobile apps are explicitly covered (including native, hybrid, and PWA experiences).

## UA expectations
1. **Inventory & prioritize** critical services (admissions, financial aid, learning platforms, HR, public news/events).
2. **Remediate** identified gaps on top 50 sites/apps by mid-2026.
3. **Document** exceptions and alternative access plans; escalate fundamental alteration claims to Legal before approval.
4. **Maintain** compliance through governance, testing, and training.

## Executive CTA
- Review current state vs. KPIs.
- Allocate budget for remediation, testing, and training resources.
- Mandate accessibility checkpoints in all digital initiatives.
