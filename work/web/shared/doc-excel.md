- **Name worksheets** descriptively and keep tab order logical.
- **Use structured tables** (Ctrl+T) with header rows so screen readers announce row/column titles.
- **Freeze panes** to keep headers visible for all users.
- **Avoid merged cells** that break navigation.
- **Add cell comments or Notes** for context that might otherwise rely on color.
- **Charts**: Provide clear labels, data tables, and alt text summarizing the insight.
- **Filters & slicers**: Ensure they are keyboard operable; provide instructions if complex.
- **Protect sheets carefully**: Verify protected ranges still allow keyboard navigation to necessary cells.
- **Testing**: Use the Accessibility Checker (Excel) or add-ons like Grackle for Sheets; spot-check with screen reader.
