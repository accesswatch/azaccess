## Why Accessible Procurement Matters

The best time to ensure accessibility is **before you buy**. Once a contract is signed, you have limited leverage to request accessibility improvements.

### The Cost of Inaccessible Purchases
- **Legal risk:** Using inaccessible technology can result in complaints and lawsuits
- **Remediation costs:** After-purchase fixes are expensive and often impossible
- **Accommodation burden:** Individual workarounds for every user with disabilities
- **Exclusion:** Students, faculty, and staff unable to use required tools

### Applies To

Accessibility review is required for:
- Software applications and SaaS platforms
- Learning management system (LMS) integrations
- Website platforms and content management systems
- Mobile applications
- Hardware with software interfaces
- Electronic documents and digital content
- Multimedia and streaming services

## The Procurement Process

### Step 1: Identify Accessibility Requirements
At the start of your procurement:
- Confirm the purchase involves technology used by people
- Determine who will use the product (students, employees, public)
- Note any specific accessibility needs you're aware of
- Contact the Digital Accessibility team for guidance if needed

### Step 2: Include Accessibility in RFP/RFQ
Your request for proposals should include:
- Statement that accessibility is a requirement
- Request for VPAT/ACR (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)
- Reference to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard
- Questions about accessibility roadmap
- Evaluation criteria that includes accessibility

### Step 3: Request VPAT from Vendor
Ask vendors to provide:
- **VPAT/ACR:** Based on current version (VPAT 2.4 or later preferred)
- **Reporting standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- **Date:** VPAT should be less than 2 years old
- **Version:** VPAT should match the product version being purchased

> **Red flags:** Vendors who don't have a VPAT, provide outdated VPATs, or claim "full compliance" without documentation.

### Step 4: Submit for Accessibility Review
1. Submit the VPAT/ACR to the Digital Accessibility team via the **ServiceNow Accessibility Review Request form**
2. Include product name, version, and intended use (e.g., student-facing, faculty-only, or public)
3. Provide vendor contact information for follow-up technical questions
4. Allow 5–7 business days for an initial risk assessment report

### Step 5: Review Results and Decide
After review, you'll receive:
- **Accessibility score:** Overall assessment of product accessibility
- **Risk level:** Low, Medium, or High
- **Key issues:** Critical accessibility gaps identified
- **Recommendation:** Proceed, proceed with conditions, or seek alternatives

### Step 6: Include Accessibility in Contract
For approved purchases, contracts should include:
- Accessibility requirements and standards
- Vendor commitment to remediate issues
- Timeline for accessibility improvements
- Right to audit or request updated VPATs
- Consequences for non-compliance

### Process Flowchart
1. **Need identified** — Involves technology?
2. Yes → **Request VPAT** from vendor
3. **Submit VPAT** to Digital Accessibility team
4. **Review completed** — Risk assessment
5. Low risk → **Proceed** with standard terms
6. Medium risk → **Proceed with conditions** (remediation plan)
7. High risk → **Seek alternatives** or document exception
8. **Contract executed** with accessibility terms

## Understanding VPATs

The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is the standard format for vendors to report product accessibility.

### What's in a VPAT
- **Product information:** Name, version, date
- **Evaluation methods:** How accessibility was tested
- **WCAG criteria:** Row-by-row assessment of success criteria
- **Conformance levels:** Supports, Partially Supports, Does Not Support, Not Applicable
- **Remarks:** Explanations and details

### Conformance Level Meanings

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Supports | Functionality meets the criterion without known defects |
| Partially Supports | Some functionality meets the criterion; some gaps exist |
| Does Not Support | Majority of functionality does not meet the criterion |
| Not Applicable | Criterion does not apply to the product |
| Not Evaluated | Not tested (concerning if used frequently) |

### Red Flags in VPATs
- "Supports" for every criterion (unrealistic)
- Many "Not Applicable" without good reason
- Vague or missing remarks
- Old date or outdated WCAG version (pre-2.1)
- Version mismatch with product being purchased
- No testing methodology described

See [Detailed VPAT Review Guide](vpat-review.html) for more.

## Accessibility Contract Language

Standard accessibility language for technology contracts:

### Requirements Clause
> "Vendor agrees that the Product shall conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA success criteria, as published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Vendor shall provide an updated Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) upon request, and at minimum with each major product release."

### Remediation Clause
> "If accessibility defects are identified, Vendor shall develop a remediation plan within 30 days and complete remediation within a mutually agreed timeline. Critical accessibility barriers that prevent users with disabilities from accessing core functionality shall be remediated within 90 days or an interim accommodation shall be provided."

### Audit Rights Clause
> "University reserves the right to conduct or commission accessibility testing of the Product at any time. Vendor shall cooperate with such testing and provide access to test environments as reasonably requested."

### Termination Clause
> "Material failure to meet accessibility requirements that renders the Product unusable for users with disabilities, if not remediated within 90 days of written notice, shall constitute grounds for termination without penalty."

## Handling Exceptions

Sometimes a product with accessibility gaps may still be needed. The exception process ensures informed decisions.

### When Exceptions May Apply
- No accessible alternative exists in the market
- Product serves a critical function with limited users
- Vendor has committed roadmap for accessibility improvements
- Effective workarounds or accommodations are available

### Exception Requirements
To approve an exception, document:
1. **Business justification:** Why this product is necessary
2. **Alternatives considered:** What other products were evaluated
3. **Risk assessment:** Who is affected and how
4. **Mitigation plan:** How users with disabilities will be accommodated
5. **Remediation timeline:** Vendor's plan to improve accessibility
6. **Review date:** When the exception will be reconsidered

### Exception Approval
- **Low risk exceptions:** Digital Accessibility Director
- **Medium risk exceptions:** Unit leadership + Digital Accessibility Director
- **High risk exceptions:** Steering Committee approval required

## The Three-Step Framework

Accessibility should be considered at each step of the procurement process. This framework, adapted from the [University of Washington's Accessible Technology procurement model](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/procurement/), provides a structured approach.

> **Key Principle:** Those responsible for making decisions about which products to procure must consider accessibility as one of the criteria for acquisition. This is especially critical for enterprise-level systems and other technologies that affect a large number of students, faculty, and/or staff.
> — Adapted from University of Washington Accessible Technology

### Step 1: Solicit Accessibility Information

Suppliers are expected to have available an **Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)** for each of their products and services, documenting their current state of accessibility as measured by WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA.

- Completing an ACR is a standard business practice that all technology vendors are expected to be familiar with
- ACRs are typically created from a [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat)
- **Third-party evaluations are encouraged**, especially for suppliers who have insufficient expertise in-house to accurately audit their own product

### Step 2: Validate Accessibility Information Received

When suppliers provide accessibility documentation, these materials must be reviewed and verified. When reviewing a supplier's ACR, consider:

1. **Does the ACR include all required information?** At a minimum: product name and version, report date, contact information for follow-up questions, and description of evaluation methods.
2. **Is the ACR reasonably current?** If the report date is more than a few months old, the information may be outdated unless the product hasn't been updated during that time.
3. **Who completed the report?** A report prepared by an independent third-party accessibility consultant is more credible than a self-report.
4. **How accessible is the product?** An ACR that declares 100% accessibility (i.e., "Supports" on every criterion) is suspicious—perfectly accessible products are extremely rare. A transparent ACR that accurately acknowledges accessibility problems is preferred.
5. **Do you understand how people with disabilities will use the product?** The Remarks/Explanations column should provide sufficient detail to answer "Yes" to this question.
6. **When can you expect the supplier to fix identified problems?** Request an accessibility roadmap indicating their plan for resolving issues.

> **Quick Keyboard Test:** One easy test that anyone can perform without specialized tools: **Test the product with a keyboard**. Anything accessible with a mouse should also be accessible with keyboard alone. If a product fails the keyboard test, this is a strong indicator of other accessibility problems.

### Step 3: Include Accessibility Assurances in Contracts

All technology suppliers are expected to provide assurances that their product is either compliant with accessibility standards, or is working toward compliance within a reasonable timeline.

- Attach a **Digital Accessibility Rider** to all contracts for applicable goods and services
- Include specific procedures for addressing accessibility within the procurement process
- Specify consequences for non-compliance and right to audit

## The Keyboard Accessibility Test

Before finalizing any technology purchase, conduct this simple but revealing test. Based on the [UW Accessible Technology keyboard checklist](https://www.washington.edu/accesstech/checklist/keyboard/).

### How to Test
1. Set aside your mouse and use only your keyboard
2. Press `Tab` to move forward through interactive elements
3. Press `Shift`+`Tab` to move backward
4. Press `Enter` or `Space` to activate buttons and links
5. Use arrow keys to navigate within menus, tabs, and other widgets
6. Press `Escape` to close dialogs and menus

### What to Check
- [ ] Can you reach every interactive element (links, buttons, form fields, menus)?
- [ ] Is focus always visible — do you know where you are on the page?
- [ ] Does focus move in a logical order (generally left to right, top to bottom)?
- [ ] Can you operate all menus, dropdowns, and dialogs?
- [ ] Can you escape from any component (no keyboard traps)?
- [ ] Can you complete the primary workflow entirely by keyboard?

> **Failure Indicator:** If the product fails the keyboard test — if you cannot accomplish tasks without a mouse — this is a **strong indicator of deeper accessibility problems**. Request demonstration of keyboard support from the vendor before proceeding.

## Digital Accessibility Checklist Framework

This checklist framework is adapted from the [University of Washington's Digital Accessibility Checklist](https://www.washington.edu/accesstech/checklist/), which organizes checkpoints by technology type and impact.

### For All Digital Content (Web, Documents, LMS)
1. **Headings** — Do headings form an outline of the page content?
2. **Lists** — Are lists used to identify content that can be described as a list of something?
3. **Images** — Do images have alt text that conveys their purpose?
4. **Tables** — Are tables used solely for data (not layout), with column and row headers identified?
5. **Color contrast** — Does the interface have sufficient contrast between text and background?
6. **Visual characteristics** — Have you avoided using color alone to communicate information?
7. **Links and buttons** — Are links and buttons labeled correctly with meaningful text?
8. **Forms** — Do form fields have appropriately coded labels and helpful error messages?
9. **Time limits** — Do pages with time limits include mechanisms for adjustment?
