1. **Initiate request**: Submit purchasing intake with accessibility flagged; include business owner, audience, data types.
2. **Vendor questionnaire**: Request latest VPAT/ACR (WCAG 2.1 or 2.2) and accessibility roadmap.
3. **Preliminary review**: Digital Accessibility team reviews VPAT, identifies risks, and recommends testing.
4. **Product demo/testing**: Conduct hands-on testing with keyboard and screen readers; capture findings.
5. **Mitigation plan**: If gaps exist, require remediation timelines, alternate access methods, or contract holdbacks.
6. **Contract language**: Include UA accessibility clause referencing WCAG conformance, reporting, and penalties for non-compliance.
7. **Post-award follow-up**: Schedule quarterly check-ins and require updated VPATs on major releases.
