## When captions are required
- **Public-facing or required course media**: Provide accurate, synchronized captions (ADA Title II effective communication).
- **Live events or classes**: Offer CART or ASL when requested; Zoom/Teams auto-captions can supplement but not replace accuracy requirements.
- **Social media snippets**: Provide open captions or platform-supported caption files; include alt text for accompanying visuals.

## Decision tree
1. **Is the video live or on-demand?**
   - *Live*: Enable platform captions (Zoom, Teams, Panopto live) + coordinate with DRC for CART/ASL when requested.
   - *On-demand*: Generate captions, edit for accuracy ≥ 99%, then publish.
2. **Which platform?**
   - *Panopto*: Request machine captions → edit in Panopto editor → publish; for high-profile content, request professional captions via UCATT.
   - *Zoom cloud recordings*: Enable audio transcript in settings, download `.vtt`, edit, re-upload.
   - *YouTube*: Upload transcript or caption file; never rely on auto-captions without editing.
   - *Adobe Premiere*: Use Speech to Text to generate captions, review, style per UA branding.
3. **Need audio description?**
   - If visuals convey essential info not spoken, record a described version or provide a text alternative.

## Quick checklist
- [ ] Captions accurate, punctuated, speaker-identified.
- [ ] Non-speech audio (music, sound effects) described when meaningful.
- [ ] Transcript provided for audio-only content.
- [ ] Player controls keyboard accessible and visible focus states tested.
- [ ] File stored with clear naming (`CourseCode_Module_Topic_captions.vtt`).

## Resources & support
- UCATT Multimedia team: video/audio production, caption procurement, DIY training.
- DRC ASL/CART request form for events (lead time: 5 business days recommended).
- Adobe Premiere & Firefly workflows for editing captions and generating accessible visuals.
