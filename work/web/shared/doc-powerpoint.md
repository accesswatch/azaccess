1. **Use slide layouts** instead of freeform text boxes so titles and content are tagged correctly.
2. **Set reading order** via the Selection Pane; ensure titles read before body elements.
3. **Describe visuals** using Alt Text; mark decorative items appropriately.
4. **Keep text minimal** and high-contrast; ensure font ≥ 24 pt.
5. **Avoid auto-advance animations** that cannot be paused with keyboard.
6. **Caption media** embedded in slides; for narrated decks, include transcripts or speaker notes.
7. **Test with Presentation Coach** to ensure clear speech and inclusive language.
8. **Export** using “File > Export > Create PDF/XPS” with document structure tags when sharing as PDF.
