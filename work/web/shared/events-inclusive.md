## Pre-event
- Publish a **disability access statement** on invitations and registration forms, with contact info and deadline for requests.
- Choose venues with accessible routes, seating, restrooms, parking, and signage; consult Campus Accessibility maps.
- Enable accessible registration forms (labels, error handling, keyboard support).
- Budget for ASL/CART, captioning, and audio description as needed.

## During event
- Provide microphones for all speakers and repeat audience questions.
- Offer seating options (aisle, companion seating) and keep pathways clear.
- For hybrid/virtual events, enable live captions and share participation instructions (chat, raise hand, phone audio).
- Distribute accessible slide decks or materials in advance when possible.

## Post-event
- Share recordings with edited captions/transcripts.
- Offer alternate formats for materials (text transcripts, tagged PDFs).
- Gather feedback on accessibility experience.
