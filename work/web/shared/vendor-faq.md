**Why does UA require accessibility documentation?**
Title II of the ADA and Section 504 mandate equal access to programs and services. Digital products must meet WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA so students, faculty, staff, and the public can use them.

**What documentation is needed?**
- Current VPAT/ACR covering WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 AA.
- Accessibility roadmap or remediation plan.
- Contact information for your accessibility lead.

**Will UA test the product?**
Yes. We perform risk-based testing (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast) and may request sandbox access.

**What if our product has gaps?**
Provide a dated remediation plan, interim accommodations, and agree to contract clauses holding you accountable for progress.

**Do we need to support assistive technologies?**
Yes. Products must work with commonly used AT (screen readers, magnifiers, voice control) on supported browsers/OS.

**Who can we contact for clarifications?**
Email accessibility@arizona.edu with “Vendor accessibility question” in the subject; include your product name and procurement reference number.
